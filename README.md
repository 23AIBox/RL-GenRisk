# RL-GenRisk
## Overview of the framework
RL-GenRisk is a novel deep reinforcement learning-based framework for clear cell renal cell carcinoma risk gene identification. RL-GenRisk frames the identification of ccRCC risk gene as a Markov decision process, and combines graph convolutional network with reinforcement learning framework. 
## Set up environment
Setup the required environment using `requirements.txt` with python. While in the project directory run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running RL-GenRisk
We upload a trained model for clear cell renal cell carcinoma risk gene identification. To run this model you can use command line instructions:
```
python identify.py
```
